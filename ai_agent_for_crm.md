# AI CRM Agent Development Project

## Medical Device Industry CRM Database

### Course Project

**Build an AI-powered CRM system that automatically discovers, extracts, organizes, and maintains customer information for the Medical Device industry using publicly available information.**

---

# Objective

The objective of this project is to expose students to:

* AI Agents
* Web Crawling
* Web Scraping
* LLM-based Information Extraction
* Entity Resolution
* CRM Design
* Database Design
* Workflow Automation
* Data Engineering
* Responsible AI and Ethical Data Collection

The final system should automatically collect information from public sources and populate a searchable CRM database.

---

# Background

Sales organizations spend significant effort identifying potential customers and decision makers.

Instead of manually searching websites, students will build an AI Agent that can discover and organize publicly available business information.

The project should **not** scrape websites that prohibit automated scraping (such as LinkedIn). Instead, students should use public and legally accessible information sources.

Examples include:

* Medtronic
* Abbott
* Boston Scientific
* Stryker
* Zimmer Biomet
* Edwards Lifesciences
* GE Healthcare
* Philips Healthcare
* Siemens Healthineers
