## FP3 — CRM Website Outline / UI Map / Repo Plan

This FP3 package should explain three things:


---

# 1. Rough Website Outline / Sitemap

## Main sitemap

The uploaded navigation map already lists these core screens: Login, Dashboard, Accounts, RFQ Pipeline, Campaigns, Inventory, Reports, Admin Users/Roles, and Settings.

# 2. UI Map by Role and Student Owner

## Super Admin UI — Owned by **All**

| Area            | What the UI shows                              | Main actions              | Student owner |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Dashboard       | Full system overview                           | View all module metrics   | All           |
| User Management | User list, roles, permissions                  | Add/edit/deactivate users | All           |
| Role Settings   | Admin, Sales, Marketing, Inventory permissions | Update access control     | All           |
| System Settings | Global settings/configuration                  | Edit app-level settings   | All           |
| Reports         | Unified reporting across all modules           | View/export reports       | All           |

**Visual layout:**
Super Admin gets the full sidebar:

```text
Dashboard
Customers
RFQs / Pipeline
Campaigns
Inventory
Reports
Admin
Settings
```

Super Admin should be able to see every module because the permission matrix says Admin has full access, user management, and system configuration. 

---

## Admin UI — Owned by **All**

| Area      | What the UI shows             | Main actions                    | Student owner |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Dashboard | CRM summary cards             | View totals and recent activity | All           |
| Customers | Accounts and contacts         | View/edit customer records      | Max           |
| RFQs      | Pipeline board and quotes     | View/edit RFQs and deals        | Trevor        |
| Campaigns | Campaign status and metrics   | View/edit campaigns             | Jonah         |
| Inventory | Products, stock, reservations | View/edit inventory             | Casey         |
| Reports   | Cross-module summaries        | View reports                    | All           |

**Visual layout:**

```text
Top Nav: Typhon Cath CRM | Search | User Menu

Sidebar:
- Dashboard
- Customers
- RFQ Pipeline
- Campaigns
- Inventory
- Reports
```

Admin is basically the “business manager” role. They can work across modules but do not need to focus on user/role configuration as much as Super Admin.

---

## Sales User UI — Owned mainly by **Trevor**, with **Max** dependency

| Area                | What the UI shows                             | Main actions                              | Student owner  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Dashboard           | Active RFQs, pipeline value, recent customers | View sales summary                        | Trevor / All   |
| Accounts            | Customer/account lookup                       | View customers before RFQ creation        | Max            |
| Create RFQ          | RFQ form linked to account/contact            | Create RFQ                                | Trevor         |
| Pipeline Board      | RFQs grouped by stage                         | Move RFQs through stages                  | Trevor         |
| RFQ Detail          | RFQ info, quote info, reserved inventory      | Edit RFQ, update stage, request inventory | Trevor         |
| Quote Form          | Amount, discount, validity period             | Create/update quote                       | Trevor         |
| Reservation Request | Products needed for RFQ                       | Request/attach inventory                  | Trevor + Casey |

Sales User should focus on the RFQ workflow. The uploaded permission matrix gives Sales User access to customer records, RFQ creation, stage updates, quotes, and RFQ win/loss status.

## Customer Management UI — Owned by **Max**

| Area                | What the UI shows                             | Main actions                | Student owner |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Accounts List       | Table of companies/accounts                   | Search, filter, add account | Max           |
| Account Detail      | Account profile, contacts, interactions, RFQs | Edit account                | Max           |
| Contacts Panel      | Contacts under an account                     | Add/edit/delete contacts    | Max           |
| Interaction History | Calls, emails, meetings, notes                | Add interaction log         | Max           |
| Import Accounts     | Upload/import customer data                   | Import records              | Max           |

**Visual layout:**

```text
Customers Page
-------------------------------------------------
Search bar | Add Account | Import
-------------------------------------------------
Accounts table
- Account Name
- Industry
- Email
- Phone
- Tags
- Last Interaction
- Actions
-------------------------------------------------
Right/detail panel or Account Detail page
```

Max owns the customer profile, contact, and interaction history pieces. The CRUD matrix lists Accounts, Contacts, and Interactions as full Customer Module responsibilities. 

---

## Marketing User UI — Owned by **Jonah**

| Area               | What the UI shows                 | Main actions             | Student owner          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Campaigns List     | Campaign table/status             | View campaigns           | Jonah                  |
| Campaign Form      | Name, type, status, content/notes | Create/edit campaign     | Jonah                  |
| Audience Selection | Tags, segments, customer filters  | Choose campaign audience | Jonah + Max dependency |
| Campaign Metrics   | Sent count, open rate, click rate | View/update metrics      | Jonah                  |
| Dashboard Card     | Campaign performance summary      | View campaign results    | Jonah / All            |

**Visual layout:**

```text
Campaigns Page
-------------------------------------------------
Create Campaign | Filter by Status
-------------------------------------------------
Campaign cards/table
- Campaign Name
- Type
- Status
- Audience Count
- Sent Count
- Open Rate
- Click Rate
-------------------------------------------------
Campaign Detail:
- Campaign Info
- Audience Criteria
- Metrics
```

The campaign flow depends on customer data because campaigns select audiences using segments, tags, or filters. 

---

## Inventory Manager UI — Owned by **Casey**

| Area                 | What the UI shows              | Main actions                         | Student owner             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Inventory List       | Products and quantities        | View/search inventory                | Casey                     |
| Product Detail       | SKU, price, description, stock | Edit product                         | Casey                     |
| Stock Update Form    | Available/reserved quantity    | Update stock                         | Casey                     |
| RFQ Reservation View | RFQ-linked reservations        | Approve/release/convert reservations | Casey + Trevor dependency |
| Low Stock Dashboard  | Low inventory alerts           | View inventory warnings              | Casey / All               |

**Visual layout:**

```text
Inventory Page
-------------------------------------------------
Search Products | Add Product | Low Stock Filter
-------------------------------------------------
Product table
- SKU
- Product Name
- Price
- Available Qty
- Reserved Qty
- Status
- Actions
-------------------------------------------------
Reservation Panel:
- RFQ #
- Product
- Quantity Reserved
- Reservation Status
```

Inventory connects directly to RFQs because RFQs can reserve products, update reserved quantity, and release/convert reservations depending on whether the RFQ is won or lost. 

---

# 3. Code Structure of the Repo

Assuming the required stack stays as **HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/Bootstrap frontend, PHP backend, and MySQL database**, the repo should look like this:

```text

    ├── rfq_tests.md

```

The uploaded architecture notes say all modules should share PHP services/includes and a shared MySQL database, so each module should have its own folder but still use shared config, auth, permissions, and database logic.
