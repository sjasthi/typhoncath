# Typhon Cath CRM — FP Weekly To-Do List

## Purpose

This document compiles the project requirements, meeting clarification notes, and FP3–FP10 weekly planning notes into one weekly to-do list for the Typhon Cath CRM project.

The goal is to make the weekly responsibilities easy to upload, review, and track during the remaining FP iterations.

---

## Important Team Note

**Jonah was originally listed as the owner for Digital Campaign Management / Marketing User UI. Jonah has since been removed from the group.**

Jonah's section is still included below for traceability because the original FP weekly list included him. Any work listed under Jonah / Marketing should be treated as **unassigned work that needs to be redistributed** among the remaining group members or discussed with the instructor.

Active listed members:

- **Max** — Customer Management
- **Trevor** — RFQ / Pipeline Management
- **Casey** — Inventory Management
- **All active members** — Integration layer, dashboard, repo structure, testing, documentation, deployment
- **Jonah / Marketing** — Removed from group; previous tasks preserved for record only

---

# 1. Project Overview

## CRM Purpose

The CRM system is designed to support Typhon Cath's internal business workflow by centralizing customer information, RFQs, marketing campaigns, inventory, and reporting in one web-based system.

Primary goals:

- Centralize customer and business interaction data
- Track sales opportunities through the RFQ lifecycle
- Manage digital marketing campaigns
- Maintain inventory visibility for products/services
- Provide a unified operational dashboard for decision-making

---

## Required Technology Stack

Frontend:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

Backend:

- PHP

Database:

- MySQL

Additional tools:

- Git / GitHub
- Apache or Nginx web server

---

## Main Project Modules

| Module | Original Owner | Current Status | Main Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Management | Max | Active | Accounts, contacts, customer profiles, interaction history |
| RFQ / Pipeline Management | Trevor | Active | RFQ creation, pipeline stages, quotes, deal tracking |
| Digital Campaign Management | Jonah | **Removed from group** | Campaign creation, segmentation, campaign metrics |
| Inventory Management | Casey | Active | Product catalog, stock tracking, inventory allocation to RFQs |
| Integration Layer | All | Active members | Shared database, dashboard, reports, RBAC, internal APIs |

---

# 2. Client / Requirement Clarifications

These notes should guide the weekly implementation work.

## Account and Contact Rules

- One account can have multiple contacts.
- Accounts can exist without contacts.
- Contacts should not exist without a corresponding account.
- A contact moving to a different company is not a major expected use case.

## Account Sources

Accounts may come from:

- Existing business knowledge
- Internet search
- Cold outreach / sales discovery
- Imported Excel data

## Pipeline Dashboard

The pipeline dashboard should not rely only on one opportunity pipeline view. It should account for multiple status categories, including:

- Open
- Won
- Lost

## Starting Data

The original manual workflow uses Excel. The CRM should support the idea that Excel data can guide schema design and possibly be imported later.

## Hosting / Deployment Concerns

The client or site owner may need to provide hosting or FTP/platform access. The group should plan how weekly work will be pushed somewhere the client/instructor can review it.

---

# 3. Required User Roles

## Super Admin

Super Admin can access everything:

- Dashboard
- Customers
- RFQs / Pipeline
- Campaigns
- Inventory
- Reports
- Admin users
- Roles
- Settings

## Admin

Admin is the business-manager style role:

- View dashboard summaries
- Work across customers, RFQs, campaigns, inventory, and reports
- Does not necessarily need deep system configuration features unless required

## Sales User

Sales User focuses on:

- Customer lookup
- RFQ creation
- RFQ detail pages
- Pipeline board
- Quote form
- Deal status changes
- Inventory reservation requests

## Marketing User

Marketing User was originally tied to Jonah's module.

**Current note:** Jonah was removed from the group, so this role and module remain part of the requirements, but the implementation responsibility is currently unassigned.

Marketing User focuses on:

- Campaign list
- Campaign create/edit form
- Audience selection
- Campaign metrics
- Campaign dashboard card

## Inventory Manager

Inventory Manager focuses on:

- Product list
- Product detail
- Stock updates
- Reserved inventory
- Low-stock indicators
- RFQ-linked inventory reservations

# 9. Cross-Module Feature Additions (Integration Layer)

These are cross-cutting features built by the active members as shared
infrastructure. They are not owned by a single module — every active module
consumes them — so they are tracked here rather than under one person's weekly
list.

## Pagination (All Active Members)

- [x] Build framework-agnostic `Paginator` core class (`app/Core/Paginator.php`).
- [x] Whitelist selectable page sizes (25 / 50 / 100) with a configurable default.
- [x] Support a "show all" option to render every row on one page.
- [x] Clamp out-of-range page requests (e.g. `?page=9999` lands on the last page).
- [x] Expose `from()` / `to()` row indices and windowed page numbers with `…` gap markers.
- [x] Build shared pagination nav partial (`app/Shared/pagination.php`) — «Prev · 1 … 4 5 6 … 12 · Next».
- [x] Preserve current query string (search, filters, sort, per_page) across page clicks.
- [x] Build shared per-page `<select>` partial (`app/Shared/per_page_select.php`).
- [x] Wire pagination into Customer (Accounts List).
- [x] Wire pagination into RFQ (Pipeline Board, Win Rate).
- [x] Wire pagination into Inventory (Products List).
- [x] Wire pagination into Campaign (Campaigns List).
- [x] Wire pagination into Admin (Users).

## CSRF Protection (All Active Members)

- [x] Build `Csrf` core class (`app/Core/Csrf.php`) with per-session token generation.
- [x] Provide `Csrf::field()` hidden-input helper and `Csrf::metaTag()` for AJAX.
- [x] Validate submitted tokens in constant time via `hash_equals` (POST body + `X-CSRF-Token` header).
- [x] Build enforcement middleware (`app/Middleware/csrf.php`) — safe methods pass, invalid/missing token returns 403.
- [x] Embed `Csrf::field()` in all POST forms across Customer, RFQ, Inventory, Campaign, and Admin.
- [x] Include the CSRF middleware in all POST handlers app-wide (login, admin users/permissions, and every module).
- [x] Add CSRF coverage test harness (`tests/csrf_coverage.php`) to verify token generation and form submission.

---

# 10. Final Submission Checklist

Use this checklist before uploading or submitting each FP package.

- [ ] Does this week's submission match the FP deliverables?
- [ ] Does each active member have visible progress?
- [ ] Are Jonah's old tasks either reassigned, documented as unassigned, or discussed with the instructor?
- [ ] Are screenshots included if the FP asks for UI progress?
- [ ] Is the repo structure clean and understandable?
- [ ] Is the database schema updated if new tables were added?
- [ ] Are source files committed to GitHub?
- [ ] Is the README updated with setup or usage notes?
- [ ] Are known bugs or limitations documented honestly?
- [ ] Can the instructor/client understand what changed this week?

---

# 11. Notes for Instructor / Reviewer

This weekly plan is based on the original four-student project structure. Jonah was originally responsible for Digital Campaign Management, but he has been removed from the group. His section remains visible so the removed work does not disappear from the planning record.

The remaining active members should either redistribute the Digital Campaign Management work or clarify with the instructor whether that module should be reduced in scope.
