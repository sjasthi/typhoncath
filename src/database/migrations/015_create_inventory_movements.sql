-- 015_create_inventory_movements.sql
-- Append-only ledger of inventory-affecting events triggered from the
-- Inventory module: product creation, attribute edits, manual stock
-- adjustments, deletions, and reservation release/convert actions taken from
-- the Inventory module's own Reservations page. Answers "what happened to
-- this product, when, and who did it" for the printable Inventory Ledger
-- report (InventoryController::ledger()).
--
-- Scope note: reservation create/release/convert actions taken from the RFQ
-- module are not logged here — that module is owned by another team and was
-- intentionally left untouched, so RFQ-driven stock changes won't appear in
-- this ledger unless/until that module's write paths call
-- InventoryRepository::logMovement() too.
--
-- product_id/user_id use ON DELETE SET NULL rather than CASCADE: a ledger
-- row must survive the product being deleted or the user account being
-- removed later, so product_name/sku and user_name are snapshotted onto the
-- row at write time instead of being resolved via JOIN at read time.
